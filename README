Debian Security Analyzer
------------------------

debsecan, the Debian Security Analyzer, is a tool to generate a list
of vulnerabilities which affect a particular Debian installation.
debsecan runs on the host which is to be checked, and downloads
vulnerability information over the Internet.  It can send mail to
interested parties when new vulnerabilities are discovered or when
security updates become available.

For details, see the debsecan(1) manual page.  For instructions how to
create a suitable, randomized cron entry, see the
debsecan-create-cron(8) manual page.

The vulnerability database is maintained by the Debian testing
security team:

  <https://security-team.debian.org/security_tracker.html>

A web interface to the database is available at:

  <https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/>

FAQ
---

Q: How can I reduce the frequency of reports (e.g. weekly instead of
   daily reporting)?

A: Just edit /etc/cron.d/debsecan to suit your needs.  Note that
   debsecan internally limits the number of reports per day to 1, so
   you cannot increase the frequency of reports, only decrease it.
